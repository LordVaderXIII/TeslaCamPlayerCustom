## 2024-05-23 - [Rate Limiting and Auth Logic]
**Vulnerability:** The `Login` endpoint used manual rate limiting that was vulnerable to bypass if the IP was not correctly detected (e.g. via proxy), and the `Update` endpoint had no rate limiting at all, allowing brute force attempts to change admin credentials.
**Learning:** Using `HttpContext.Connection.RemoteIpAddress` without proper Forwarded Headers configuration can lead to security bypasses or DoS (if all users share the proxy IP).
**Prevention:** Use ASP.NET Core's built-in `RateLimiting` middleware which handles policies more consistently. Ensure `ForwardedHeadersOptions` are configured correctly in containerized environments (which `Program.cs` already had).
